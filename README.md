# Real-World Pose Estimation and Sensor Fusion for Mobile Robotics

## Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time pose estimation and sensor fusion pipeline for mobile robotics by integrating:
- A **lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with Monte Carlo dropout for predicting 6D pose (position and orientation) from monocular images.
- An **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** that fuses noisy CNN measurements with simulated odometry (control inputs) to provide robust localization.
- **Simulated camera calibration and extrinsic transformation** to mimic real-world sensor integration.

The goal is to develop a cost-effective, real-time localization system suitable for resource-constrained environments (e.g., GPS-denied indoor/outdoor settings).

## Features

- **Real-Time Pose Estimation:**  
  Utilizes a lightweight CNN architecture for fast inference, predicting the robot's pose directly from images.
  
- **Uncertainty Estimation:**  
  Employs Monte Carlo dropout to obtain both pose predictions and an estimate of their uncertainty, enhancing reliability.

- **Adaptive Sensor Fusion:**  
  Integrates an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that adaptively fuses CNN outputs with odometry data, accounting for the CNN's uncertainty.

- **Simulated Real-World Integration:**  
  Includes simulated camera calibration (intrinsic and extrinsic parameters) and sensor data to bridge the gap between simulation and practical deployment.

- **Visualization:**  
  Provides real-time plots comparing the true state, CNN measurements, and EKF estimates to evaluate system performance.

## Impact

This project has significant potential impact on both research and practical applications in mobile robotics:
- **Cost-Effective Localization:**  
  Leverages standard, low-cost sensors combined with efficient deep learning models, making advanced localization accessible on resource-constrained platforms.
  
- **Enhanced Robustness:**  
  By fusing complementary sensor data, the system offers improved accuracy and resilience in challenging, GPS-denied environments such as indoor facilities, disaster zones, or subterranean settings.

- **Versatility and Scalability:**  
  The modular design allows easy integration of additional sensors (e.g., LiDAR, depth cameras) and advanced filtering techniques (e.g., Unscented Kalman Filter), making the system adaptable to various robotic platforms.

- **Educational and Research Value:**  
  Provides a practical, hands-on project for exploring the intersection of deep learning, sensor fusion, and robotics, which can inspire further innovations in autonomous navigation.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation:**  
  Generates a dummy dataset of images and 6D pose labels for training the CNN.

- **CNN Model with Dropout:**  
  Implements a lightweight CNN that outputs pose estimates along with uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout.

- **Monte Carlo Uncertainty Estimation:**  
  Functions to perform multiple stochastic forward passes through the network to compute the mean prediction and its variance.

- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):**  
  Fuses CNN predictions (with adaptive measurement noise from dropout variance) and simulated odometry to estimate the robot's state.

- **Real-World Simulation:**  
  Simulates camera calibration, extrinsic transformations, and sensor integration to mimic a real robotic environment.

- **Visualization:**  
  Plots trajectories and uncertainty metrics to evaluate the performance of the sensor fusion pipeline.
